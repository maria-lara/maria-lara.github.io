# My Personal Portfolio

## Description
This website was created as my first personal portfolio online. The purpose of this website is to showcase my personal and school projects, as well as introduce folks to who I am as a person, outside of development.

This website was created using Bootstrap, which encompasses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So far, this website includes a blurb about me, my portfolio, and a contact form for those who wish to message me. This biggest learning from this website was how to make pages and elements responsive using Bootstrap. 

I plan to continute developing this website with more projects, a better design scheme, and some new elements created with JavaScript.
