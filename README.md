# My Personal Portfolio

## Description
This website was created as my first personal portfolio online. The purpose of this website is to showcase my personal and school projects and introduce folks to who I am as a person, outside of development.

This website was created using Bootstrap, which encompasses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So far, this website includes a blurb about me, my portfolio, and a contact form for those who wish to message me. This biggest learning from this website was how to make pages and elements responsive using Bootstrap. 

I plan to continute developing this website with more projects, a better design scheme, and some new elements created with JavaScript.
